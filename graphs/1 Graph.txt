- Cycle Detection in Undirected graphs
  using BSF & DFS
- Cycle Detection in directed graphs
  using DFS
  using BSF(kahn's algo toposort) 
- Topological Sort
  using DFS
  kahan's algo
- Shortest Path in Undirected Graph with unit weight for each edges:
  BSF Traversal
  single sorce shortest path
- Shortest Path in DAG
  topo sort and then update distance vector
  single sorce shortest path
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
  priority queue
  Shortest Path in UAG(undirected acyclic graph) +ve weights only
  single sorce shortest path 
- Prim's Algo
- Kruskal's Algo for MST
  MST
  joint disjoint set
- Bridges in a Graph: 
  during back update low[node]=min[low[node],low[nbr]]
  during back in dfs if(low[nbr]>disc[node]) then it is bridge 
- Articulation points
  same as Bridges with additional case parent !=-1
  if(low[nbr]>=disc[node] && parent !=-1){
                    		             ap[node]=true;
                 			 }
                			child++;
- Kosaraju's Algorithm: 
  Strongly connected components
  toposort(to detect cycle cycle)
  transpose graph  babbar: stack gives reverse order so transpose graph
  DSF
  done 100% 
- Bellman Ford Algorithm: 
  Shortest Path in UAG +ve and -ve weights(no negative cycle)
  take U forward : in worst case every cycle check only one weight so n-1 time cycle but even after that weight is still update then negative cycle is there.
