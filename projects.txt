Online Marketplace: Design an online marketplace where users can buy and sell products. Implement efficient data structures like heaps or balanced binary search trees for managing product listings and performing quick searches.



File Compression Tool: Build a file compression tool using data compression algorithms such as Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW). Implement data structures like priority queues or hash maps to optimize compression and decompression operations.




Job Scheduling System: Develop a job scheduling system that optimizes the allocation of resources to tasks. Implement scheduling algorithms like round-robin, shortest job first, or priority-based scheduling using appropriate data structures.
